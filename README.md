## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was excellent practice for the skills I already have, but I also picked up something new. Previously, I was unaware that two or more background images could be used for one div. I tried using two separate divs, one for each image, but that was clumsy and didn't work out. After some time spent on [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_background_multiple), I was able to figure it out and get the images in the right place.

### Continued development

This will probably be tweaked here and there when it comes to padding/margins. However, I will mostly re-use this component when building websites. I may also turn it into a React component at some point.
